#  Live Log Analyzer

A real-time, event-driven log monitoring system built with Node.js.

It continuously watches a log file, detects important patterns like SQL injections or failed logins, alerts on spikes of errors, and saves high-priority events to a persistent alert log â€” just like production-grade observability systems (Logstash, Datadog, Splunk).

---

##  Features

âœ… Real-time log monitoring using Node streams
âœ… Pattern detection for:
  - SQL injection attempts
  - Login failures
  - Suspicious paths (e.g., `/admin`, `/etc/passwd`)
âœ… Error spike detection: 10+ `[ERROR]` logs within 60 seconds
âœ… Persistent alert logging to `alerts/security.log`
âœ… Modular, scalable structure
âœ… DEMO mode for instant simulation

##  Tech Stack

- Node.js (built-in modules: `fs`, `readline`, `events`, `path`)
- Event-driven architecture
- Regex-based rule engine
- File streaming + time-window detection
